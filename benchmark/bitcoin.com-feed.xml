He explained that despite the lawsuit over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, Ripple had the &#x201C;strongest year ever.&#x201D;</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-501212 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/garlinghouse.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="260"></p><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him, Ripple Labs, and co-founder Chris Larsen a year ago. The securities watchdog alleged that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> should have been registered as a security.</p><p>While insisting that the SEC&#x2019;s lawsuit against <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> &#x201C;is an attack on crypto in the US, not just Ripple,&#x201D; Garlinghouse detailed:</p><blockquote><p>2021 has been a watershed year for crypto. Acceptance and awareness of the opportunity to bring billions of people into the global financial community has never been so clear. It&#x2019;s been incredible to see a lot less &#x2018;maximalism&#x2019;, and many more builders joining the industry.</p></blockquote><p>The CEO proceeded to outline Ripple&#x2019;s progress over the year, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripple-sbi-launch-on-demand-liquidity-japan-xrp-surges/">launching</a> new On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors and its central bank digital currency (CBDC) solution. &#x201C;All of this growth came from outside the US,&#x201D; he opined.</p><p>Garlinghouse then noted that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler &#x201C;has taken an aggressively anti-crypto approach and companies are already moving outside the US.&#x201D; He asserted that &#x201C;the SEC today won&#x2019;t answer questions about the legal status of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, much less anything else,&#x201D; elaborating:</p><blockquote><p>Calling crypto the &#x2018;Wild West&#x2019; is a farce &#x2013; most are complying with financial regulators globally. This industry shouldn&#x2019;t be punished for asking for regulatory clarity & regulation that is consistently applied with a level playing field.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>What do you think about Garlinghouse&#x2019;s comments?

The executive</strong><strong> personally owns 17,732 bitcoins while his company is hodling 122,478 bitcoins.</strong></p><h2>Microstrategy&#x2019;s CEO Expects Bitcoin to Hit $6 Million</h2><p>Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor talked about his bitcoin strategy and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price prediction in a recent interview with the Information, published this week.</p><p>Saylor revealed that he personally owns at least 17,732 bitcoins, which is the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-ceo-million-bitcoin-btc-profit/">same amount</a> he disclosed back in October last year. At the current<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price, his bitcoin stash is worth almost $858 million.</p><p>The Microstrategy executive never sold any of his bitcoins and does not believe they should ever be sold. Furthermore, the Information reported:</p><blockquote><p>Saylor foresees bitcoin hitting $600,000 a coin, and eventually $6 million.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Microstrategy has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-holds-122478-btc-ceo-bitcoin-taking-golds-place/">amassed</a> 122,478<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth almost $6 billion at the current price. The coins were acquired at an average purchase price of $29,861 and for the cost basis of $3.7 billion, according to the company&#x2019;s &#x201C;Investor Day&#x201D; presentation, published last week.</p><p>Microstrategy described itself as &#x201C;the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and the first public company to adopt bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset.&#x201D; Its corporate strategy is to &#x201C;Acquire and hold bitcoin long-term&#x201D; and &#x201C;purchase bitcoin through use of excess cash flows, and debt and equity transactions.&#x201D;</p><p>In November, Saylor said that bitcoin was &#x201C;unstoppable&#x201D; and will &#x201C;emerge as a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-ceo-bitcoin-100-trillion-asset-class-btc-grow-100x/">$100 trillion asset class</a>.&#x201D; The CEO has repeatedly said that<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will replace gold. He said early this month: &#x201C;Once upon a time, gold was the most desirable store of value. Now bitcoin is<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-buys-more-bitcoin-holds-122478-btc-ceo-bitcoin-taking-golds-place/">taking its place</a>.&#x201D;</p><p><em><strong>What do you think about Michael Saylor&#x2019;s bitcoin price prediction?

The PWC Hong Kong branch will be the first internationally recognized professional services brand to enter The Sandbox metaverse.</strong></p><h2>PWC Hong Kong Enters the Metaverse</h2><p>While land located next to Snoop Dogg&#x2019;s Sandbox plot has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/virtual-land-adjacent-to-snoop-doggs-sandbox-estate-sells-for-450k-in-ethereum/">sold for lots of money</a> and other firms like Atari have purchased Sandbox property, now major accounting firm PWC&#x2019;s Hong Kong branch has also purchased metaverse land in The Sandbox virtual world.</p><p>PWC is a multinational professional services network of firms located in 156 countries. The company is often referred to as one of the Big Four accounting firms alongside EY, KPMG, and Deloitte. PWC&#x2019;s Hong Kong branch has been into blockchain technology and crypto assets for quite some time and in November 2017, the office <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-four-firm-pwcs-hong-kong-office-accepts-bitcoin/">revealed</a> it accepted bitcoin payments for consultancy services.</p><p>The announcement on December 23 says that the land in The Sandbox was specifically acquired by PWC Hong Kong. William Gee, a partner at PWC Hong Kong, commented about the land purchase and the metaverse in general on Thursday.</p><p>&#x201C;The metaverse offers new possibilities for organisations to create value through innovative business models, as well as introducing new ways to engage with their customers and communities,&#x201D; Gee remarked. The PWC Hong Kong executive added:</p><blockquote><p>We will leverage our expertise to advise clients who wish to embrace the metaverse on the full range of challenges presented by this emerging global digital phenomenon.</p></blockquote><h2>&#x2018;The Metaverse Is Open for Business&#x2019; &#x2014; The Sandbox Team Believes PWC Can Help &#x2018;Brands That May Be Less Familiar With Web3&#x2019;</h2><p>The Sandbox virtual blockchain game, that features land and other types of non-fungible token (NFT) assets, has been popular during the last year. The Sandbox&#x2019;s native digital asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-sandbox">SAND</a> is up 11% during the last 30 days and 11,714% over the course of the last year. The blockchain-based metaverse game also<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-sandbox-scores-93-million-investment-led-by-softbank-as-metaverse-tokens-thrive/">secured an investment</a> of $93 million during the first week of November in a financing round led by Softbank&#x2019;s Vision Fund 2.</p><p>Regarding the PWC land acquisition, The Sandbox says &#x201C;professional services firms such as PWC Hong Kong can play a valuable role in the growth of the open metaverse.&#x201D; Specifically, the announcement explains that PWC can help &#x201C;brands that may be less familiar with Web3.&#x201D; Sebastien Borget, COO of The Sandbox believes the Big Four accounting firm is at the forefront of this innovation.</p><p>&#x201C;The metaverse is open for business,&#x201D; Borget elaborated in a statement concerning PWC Hong Kong&#x2019;s land acquisition in the metaverse. &#x201C;We welcome PWC Hong Kong to experience how The Sandbox fosters new immersive experiences and ways for brands to connect with customers. It&#x2019;s an exciting time &#x2013; and PWC is at the forefront of this emerging frontier.&#x201D;</p><p><em><strong>What do you think about the accounting firm PWC Hong Kong acquiring land in The Sandbox metaverse?

New research claims Pakistanis keep some $20 billion in cryptocurrency, allegedly more than what their central bank has in foreign reserves. </strong></p><h2>Government Urged for Regulations as Study Shows Pakistanis Hold $20 Billion in Cryptocurrency</h2><p>The Pakistani nation owns more cryptocurrency than foreign reserves, according to the Pakistan Frontier and other media outlets quoting a new report by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI). The study, produced by the association&#x2019;s Policy Advisory Board (PAB), has estimated that Pakistanis have held cryptocurrency worth $20 billion in the 2020-21 period.</p><p>The authors point out that the popularity of digital currencies like bitcoin has rapidly increased in the last couple of years. With a 711% market growth in 12 months, Pakistan climbed to third place in this year&#x2019;s Global Crypto Adoption <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Index</a> calculated by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis. The country is behind only India and Vietnam.</p><p>However, the true total of crypto holdings may be much higher than the figure mentioned in the PAB report. Many residents of the country are buying coins via peer-to-peer deals and these investments remain largely undetected, the Business Recorder notes in an article. Cryptocurrencies are still a gray area in Pakistan as the country&#x2019;s current legislation does not cover the digital assets.</p><p>During a press conference, FPCCI President Nasir Hayat Magoon urged Islamabad to introduce a government policy that would facilitate cryptocurrency transactions, remarking that neighboring <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-seeks-wider-consultation-before-finalizing-crypto-bill/">India</a> has already taken steps to implement some rules. Magoon insisted that such regulations are needed so that investors can trade their coins in the country instead of in places like<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-to-create-crypto-zone-binance-joins-effort/">Dubai</a>.</p><p>The report recommends that Pakistan adopt a legal framework aligned with guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force and the International Monetary Fund. The study has been released after Pakistan&#x2019;s Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pakistan-government-not-against-crypto-investments-high-court-calls-for-regulations/">indicated</a> in October that the government is not opposed to cryptocurrency investments in general. Pakistan&#x2019;s courts have also called on the executive and legislative powers to introduce crypto regulations.</p><p><em><strong>Do you expect authorities in Pakistan to soon regulate the country&#x2019;s crypto space?

There is no maximum supply cap. However, the creation of additional tokens is directly tied with users&#x2019; marketplace transactions. ETHR can only be minted by exchanging customers&#x2019; transaction-generated points for ETHR. This is the only way that additional tokens are created and promotes platform utilization.</p><p>These <a href="https://www.ethair.com/content/points.html">points</a> are Ethair&#x2019;s rewards system and they are gained on every successful transaction. They function as part of the 25% reimbursement of Final Value Fees for each transaction given to both parties, and as such reduce marketplace fees even further.</p><p>When a user requests to exchange their points into an ETHR token, our smart contract first gives them a platform-exclusive bonus of 10% more than the value exchanged in ETHR. This multiplies the request by two. The newly minted ETHR is then supplied to the user and the remainder is evenly distributed between two pools.</p><p>The referral <a href="https://www.ethair.com/content/referral-program.html">program</a> rewards users who have referred verified marketplace customers with a share of generated pool rewards. These rewards will be doled out monthly for a limited time 1-year period after which the governance voting will decide what the next use of this pool will be.</p><p>Company Account pool is aimed (but not limited to) to be used for promotions and partnerships.</p><p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20211222%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20211222T110005Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=de860a2725090579fa968c04f595b07b9c5ecb39e4424b0d3c9c329dee7e52a5"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-501064" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-300x169.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-1024x576.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-768x432.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-190x107.png 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-380x214.png 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example-760x428.png 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toek_minting_example.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></a></p><p><b>Company goals and expansion</b></p><p>Ethair&#x2019;s goal is to be a more customer-friendly platform.

On the other hand, the study asserts that exchange and trading desk-related volume &#x2014; which is mostly speculative &#x2014; constitutes about 80% of the total volume.</p><p>In their analysis, the authors of a report released by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) appear to debunk the assertion that illegal transactions dominate bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) trade volumes. In particular, the authors, Igor Makarov from the London School of Economics and Antoinette Schoar of the MIT Sloan School of Management, explain how earlier studies were likely to be overstating the economic value of illegal trades.</p><p>To support their argument, the two authors point to a 2019 study that had concluded that more than 46% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions are due to illegal transactions. The authors stated:</p><blockquote><p>First, Foley et al. (2019) intentionally drop all exchange-related volumes from their calculations, since they want to focus only on payments for goods and services. Since we show above that trading constitutes the main activity on the blockchain, this choice severely changes the denominator.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, the authors said the estimate of volume in the Foley study is based on what they termed an imputed network of illegal clusters where any cluster recursively is deemed illegal if the majority of its transactions are with previously identified illegal clusters.</p><h2>Drivers of Bitcoin Volume and Value</h2><p>Although the two authors agree that this method is appealing, they nonetheless argue that this &#x201C;does not discriminate between real users and short-lived pass-through clusters that exist solely to obfuscate tracing.&#x201D;</p><p>Unlike the method that was used in the 2019 study, Makarov and Schoar do incorporate exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, or trading desk data when computing the non-spurious <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> volumes. Consequently, in their analysis, the two authors conclude that exchange and trading desk-related volume constitutes about 80% of the total volume while other known entities are only responsible for a minor part of total volume as of the end of 2020.</p><p>While Makarov and Schoar suggested in their report that they agreed with the general concern over the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin transactions, they however insisted that it is &#x201C;important to get the magnitudes of transaction activities right in order to understand what are the ultimate drivers of bitcoin value.&#x201D;</p><p><em><strong>Do you agree with this study&#x2019;s conclusion about the size of illegal transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain? Tell us what you think in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

The move is part of efforts to support new industries and the emirate intends to source help from crypto companies like Binance.</strong></p><h2>Dubai World Trade Centre to Host and Regulate Crypto Space</h2><p>Authorities in the United Arab Emirates plan to establish a special zone at the Dubai World Trade Centre (<a href="https://www.dwtc.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DWTC</a>) from which businesses dealing with digital assets will be able to offer their products and services. The government of Dubai announced that the DWTC will also play the role of a regulator for the sector, enforcing &#x201C;rigorous standards for investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) compliance and cross border deal flow tracing.&#x201D;</p><p>According to an official announcement, the goal is to further develop Dubai&#x2019;s virtual assets space and market by introducing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-financial-watchdog-to-release-consultation-papers-for-a-crypto-regulatory-framework/">regulatory framework</a> for innovative financial products that includes legislative and enforcement policies. Officials hope this will facilitate the adoption of new blockchain-related trends and improve Dubai&#x2019;s standing as a global business center.</p><h2>Binance Considering Headquarters in UAE</h2><p>Dubai authorities also emphasized that the DWTC will work together with the private sector and other relevant entities to create an attractive environment for the crypto industry. One such collaboration has already been agreed with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-developing-crypto-exchange-in-indonesia/">Binance</a>, the world&#x2019;s largest digital asset exchange in terms of volume, the Straits Times reported. Dubai wants to license such crypto trading platforms and other blockchain businesses.</p><p>Under a memorandum of understanding signed with the authority governing the Dubai World Trade Centre, Binance will share its experience with regulators in other jurisdictions with the administration, the company announced on Tuesday. A report by Bloomberg revealed that the exchange has been negotiating with Dubai and Abu Dhabi to set up its headquarters in UAE.</p><p>According to the Straits Times, Binance&#x2019;s founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao recently bought a home in Dubai and met key representatives of the local crypto industry while praising the emirate&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-government-licensing-entity-now-accepts-bitcoin-for-payments/">pro-crypto</a> stance on social media. The executive has been quoted as saying in a statement released on Tuesday:</p><blockquote><p>Today, the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology remains in its infancy, but through our leadership position and expertise, combined with the long-term vision of Dubai, we plan to develop a regulatory framework appropriate to fit the fast-moving and progressive nature of virtual assets.</p></blockquote><p>The report notes that energy-rich Dubai has been trying to boost non-oil growth in order to ensure the sustainability of its economy. The project to turn the Dubai World Trade Centre into a regulated zone for cryptocurrency operations is part of these efforts.</p><p><em><strong>Do you expect Dubai to become a crypto hotspot in the near future?
