            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Coinbase Transparency Report -Q1-Q3, 2021</h3><p><em>By Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5gt3zU3RijpyerBV.png" /></figure><p>Coinbase is proud to publish our third Transparency Report. This report covers the period between January 1 through September 30, 2021*. As Coinbase continues to grow and offer services in new markets, the number of legitimate information requests we receive from law enforcement agencies and other government agencies will increase accordingly. As such, moving forward, we will publish these reports on an annual basis.</p><p>The goal of these reports, which we began publishing in 2020 (our two prior reports can be found <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/transparency-at-coinbase-c8edf6dce4d6">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-transparency-report-h2-2020-b8ef1632c4dc">here</a>), is to keep our customers informed about requests for customer information we receive from government agencies and law enforcement — how many we have received, where they come from, and our approach in responding to them. While transparency reports are common in the technology industry, we believe financial institutions should similarly publish these reports on a regular basis, and we encourage them to do so.</p><p>At Coinbase, the safety of our customers is very important to us, and we respect the key role of law enforcement and government agencies in pursuing bad actors who engage in prohibited activity or seek to abuse our platform. At the same time, protecting the financial privacy of our customers is a fundamental part of our commitment to being the most trusted place to engage with cryptocurrency. This report shares data on the requests for information that Coinbase receives from government and law enforcement agencies around the world and provides a view into how government policies and actions intersect with customer privacy.</p><h3>Coinbase Transparency Report</h3><h3>Period: January 1, 2021 — Sept. 30, 2021</h3><p>Coinbase currently serves more than <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/about#:~:text=Customers%20around%20the%20world%20discover,%2C%20earn%2C%20and%20use%20crypto.">73 million</a> customers worldwide. We regularly receive and respond to requests from law enforcement and government agencies seeking customer account information and financial records in connection with civil, criminal, or other investigative matters. These requests can include subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, or other forms of formal legal process. We have an obligation to respond to such requests if they are valid under financial regulations and other applicable laws.</p><p>Each request is carefully reviewed by a team of trained experts using established procedures to determine its legal sufficiency; where necessary, we will narrow or <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-obtains-partial-victory-over-irs-dac041db59a3">push back</a> on requests that appear overly broad or vague. The charts below provide data on the number of requests that we have received and how we have responded to them, broken down by country. As we continue to enhance our processes, we will be publishing this report annually, subject to certain limitations.</p><h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3><ul><li>There were a total of 5,562 requests in the first three quarters of 2021, and ~51% of requests came from outside of the United States.</li><li>~84% of requests are from the U.S., U.K., and Germany.</li><li>Countries that sent requests for the first time in 2021 include Latvia, Greece, India, Turkey, Bosnia, Hungary, and Russia.</li><li>The number of requests we received in the first three quarters of this year represents a ~27% increase from the total number of requests we received in all of 2020.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HLONXlgSEBbbRYlR" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f2N3gf4HjMSbrlW9PWUbeQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3xD5oavunwVGcfDu" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Bn9CFhEjOGYX_ZKB" /></figure><h3><strong>FAQs:</strong></h3><p><strong>Does this report include data about requests received by all Coinbase entities/services?</strong></p><p>This report includes data about requests related to our various products and services including coinbase.com, coinbase.com/exchange, coinbase.com/prime, and custody.coinbase.com.</p><p><strong>What does it mean if my country is not listed on the report?</strong></p><p>We only include countries where (i) our services are available, and/or (ii) Coinbase received a government or law enforcement request.</p><p><strong>What is a government information request?</strong></p><p>A variety of laws allow the government and law enforcement agencies of a given country to request the disclosure of customer information for civil, administrative, criminal, and national security purposes, including as part of an investigation.</p><p><strong>What information does Coinbase provide in response to government and law enforcement requests?</strong></p><p>Depending on the nature and scope of the request, Coinbase may produce certain customer information, such as name, recent login/logout IP address, and payment information; this type of information may be subject to requests by government and law enforcement agencies when a customer uses one of our applications or our website, as described in our privacy policy.</p><p>Before we consider disclosing information in response to a government or law enforcement request (such as a subpoena, court order, or similar legal process), we review each request on an individual basis. If we believe a request is over-broad or vague, we seek to narrow it and provide a more appropriately tailored response, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all (such as if the request is legally insufficient).</p><p><strong>Does Coinbase challenge or reject government requests?</strong></p><p>Coinbase may challenge government and law enforcement requests, depending on the particular circumstances of each request. Under certain circumstances, we may ask the government or law enforcement agency to narrow their request.</p><p><strong>Who reviews government requests for user information at Coinbase?</strong></p><p>Coinbase has a trained team of lawyers, analysts, and other experts who review and evaluate each government and law enforcement request individually to assess its legal sufficiency and determine an appropriate response.</p><p><strong>Does Coinbase provide governments with direct access to customer information?</strong></p><p>Coinbase does not give any government in any jurisdiction (including law enforcement, or other government agencies) direct access to customer information on our or any third-party’s systems.</p><p>###</p><blockquote>* Data for the remainder of 2021 will be captured in our next report, to be published in 2022.</blockquote><blockquote>(2) Coinbase receives various criminal, civil and administrative requests from regulators and agencies in various countries seeking information about specific accounts and transactions. This Transparency Report reflects data related to these requests; it does not include customer initiated requests for information or productions required as part of routine regulatory examinations.</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=80bb5c785da" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-transparency-report-q1-q3-2021-80bb5c785da">Coinbase Transparency Report — — Q1-Q3, 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Group Product Manager</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M7f5DG5IK5wFhPB8HJwp9Q.png" /></figure><p>More and more people are discovering the benefits of crypto, web3, and blockchain-enabled experiences. To meet the needs of these new users, we are investing in accessible and user-friendly experiences that make it easier to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) and collect non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We believe this is especially important for self-custody wallets given the added responsibility placed on the user in managing their own crypto.</p><p>With Coinbase Wallet, we are building the most user-friendly self-custody experience in crypto, including making it easier to manage your crypto across a range of supported networks. We are also adding some of our users’ most requested features to Wallet extension, including the ability to natively trade on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and bringing NFT collections directly into the browser.</p><h4>Many networks, one wallet</h4><p>The surge of interest in crypto this year has sparked many positive developments, but it also has exposed some of the pain points associated with scaling. High network fees and longer processing times on the most popular blockchains are major hurdles for continuing to grow the use of crypto around the world.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a lot of activity within the crypto community that aims to address today’s scaling issues. Layer 2 solutions, sidechains, and Layer 1 networks that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are playing a vital role in helping Ethereum scale, making it more affordable and efficient to trade crypto, buy NFTs, or borrow from a liquidity pool.</p><p>And these networks are becoming more and more popular. Over the past 60 days, we have seen a 300% increase in the number of daily Coinbase Wallet mobile users who switch their active network at least once. This means that users are increasingly using Coinbase Wallet to access dapps, including DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, on networks that may offer lower network fees and faster transaction times.</p><p>But more networks can mean more work for the user. Having to keep track of token balances split across multiple networks and manually switch between networks to access dapps and crypto experiences makes for a prohibitively complex user experience.</p><p>Coinbase Wallet is making it easier than ever to enjoy the benefits of these networks without the hassle or headache. In both the mobile app and desktop browser extension, Coinbase Wallet will now show your token balances across all supported networks in one simple, unified view. In addition to assets held on the Ethereum mainnet, Wallet will display tokens on the Arbitrum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Optimism, Polygon, and xdai networks.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FuIS2RCOQ_kk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuIS2RCOQ_kk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FuIS2RCOQ_kk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/18056da9c1aa0f01a471b368c967a468/href">https://medium.com/media/18056da9c1aa0f01a471b368c967a468/href</a></iframe><p>To round out our scaling updates for 2021, we have also added support for EIP-3085, which allows dapps to suggest a specific network to the user. When a dapp wants to suggest a network that differs from the user’s current network, Coinbase Wallet will ask the user to confirm the switch. This removes the guesswork of picking the right network and cuts down the number of steps it takes to change between networks — with just one tap on mobile or one click on desktop, your wallet will be ready to go.</p><h4>Direct access to decentralized exchanges</h4><p>At the beginning of 2021, we introduced support for Coinbase Wallet mobile users to trade on decentralized exchanges right from their Wallet home screen. Powered by APIs with Uniswap and 0x, Wallet users suddenly could trade over 4,000 tokens right from the comfort of their Coinbase Wallet app.</p><p>In November, we launched our standalone browser extension for Coinbase Wallet, making it easy for users to engage with dapps, earn interest with DeFi, and collect NFTs from their computer. The latest update to Wallet extension brings the native DEX trading functionality that Wallet mobile users have enjoyed on their phones into the Wallet extension.</p><p>With Wallet extension’s built-in price charts and the new ‘<strong>Convert’</strong> button, users can stay up to date on what’s happening in the crypto markets and execute trades with just a few clicks.</p><h4>Looks rare</h4><p>We are excited to announce that your NFT collection is coming to Coinbase Wallet’s browser extension. Soon, users will be able to view their NFT collection from within the Coinbase Wallet extension, easily see their NFTs’ attributes, and easily access popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.</p><p>We will be launching support for NFTs in the browser extension in just a few days, so make sure you have the latest version of the browser extension installed from the Chrome webstore.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RioU3bJqMNSUCQiXW6HP5g.gif" /></figure><h4>Unlocking the world of crypto in 2022</h4><p>This year has been filled with major milestones for Coinbase Wallet, but it is truly just the beginning. We want to empower everyone to use dapps and web3 by building the easiest-to-use and most accessible self-custody wallet in the ecosystem, with a major focus on lowering the barriers to entry for self-custody.</p><p>We have ambitious plans for Wallet next year, including making our native DEX trading feature more accessible and affordable and leveling up the experience of buying, selling, and collecting NFTs. And just last week, we announced that Wallet will support hardware wallets in early 2022, a major enhancement that will introduce new levels of security and choice to Wallet’s users.</p><p>Experience the latest enhancements for yourself by <a href="https://coinbase-wallet.onelink.me/q5Sx/36aa7809">downloading Coinbase Wallet</a> for free from the App Store on iOS, Google Play on Android, or the Chrome web store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Rhea Kaw, Senior Product Manager</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eeylmWXJpiLRmDOX_G-mZQ.png" /></figure><p>Today we’re introducing a new way for Coinbase’s global customers to put their crypto to work and earn yield. We are making DeFi more accessible, enabling eligible customers in more than 70 countries to access the attractive yields of DeFi from their Dai with no fees, lockups, or set-up hassle.</p><h4>Access DeFi from the comfort of your Coinbase account</h4><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is becoming one of the most popular use cases for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies because it enables people to access crypto applications without the need for a centralized intermediary.</p><p>However, accessing DeFi protocols can require expensive network fees and involve a somewhat complex user experience. Coinbase is making DeFi more customer friendly and accessible. Eligible users will now be able to access the attractive yields of DeFi from the comfort of their Coinbase account with just a few taps and without the network fees.</p><p>Starting today, you’ll be able to earn DeFi yield on <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/dai">Dai</a>, a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-stablecoin">stablecoin</a> that is designed to be pegged to the US Dollar.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_9_tE5HVEXnSUwgJs75nUw.gif" /></figure><p>When you opt in to earn DeFi yield, your Dai is deposited into Compound Finance, an industry-leading DeFi protocol. The offered APY varies based on the <a href="https://compound.finance/markets/DAI">rates from Compound</a> and will automatically update to reflect changes in the market. Compound’s rates are variable — as an example, during the month of October, the APY for supplying DAI fluctuated between 2.83% and 5.39%.</p><p>These higher rates reflect both the unique access to global liquidity and increased risk that can come with DeFi. Though Coinbase monitors these protocols regularly, we cannot guarantee against potential losses. One way that DeFi protocols endeavor to mitigate risk of loss is to use overcollateralization, which means that they hold excess assets to cover potential losses. This is a unique form of investment, so it is always best to make an informed investment decision.</p><p>Even when deposited with Compound, your Dai remains available to you on Coinbase at all times, letting you continue to trade and spend as usual. Best of all, Coinbase covers the gas fees typically required to access DeFi protocols and their variable yields.</p><h4>Get Started Today</h4><p>DeFi has tremendous potential to help increase economic freedom, and we’re excited to be able to provide a trusted and accessible way to participate. Today’s launch is just the beginning — we are continuing to explore ways to allow our customers to use a wider variety of assets and a greater number of DeFi protocols.</p><p>Earning DeFi-powered yield on Dai is now available for eligible Coinbase users in over 70 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. DeFi Yield is not currently available for customers in the United States. We will continue to work to bring DeFi Yield to more countries to reach more of our customers.</p><p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/dai">Dai asset page</a> in the Coinbase app or on Coinbase.com. In addition to being in an eligible jurisdiction, you must have Dai in your Coinbase wallet in order to enter the DeFi Yield experience. Once you have a Dai balance, go to the Dai asset page, choose the DeFi Yield tile to review, and accept the terms to start earning.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bd38156e2715" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-makes-it-easy-to-earn-yield-with-defi-bd38156e2715">Coinbase makes it easy to earn yield with DeFi</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delivered by Alesia Haas, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ityM_nBV4RVmP5eGiWqzg.png" /></figure><p>Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry and Members of the Committee, good morning and thank you for this opportunity to testify on digital assets and the future of finance.</p><p>My name is Alesia Haas and I am Chief Financial Officer of Coinbase Global Inc. I also serve in the role of Chief Executive Officer of our U.S. subsidiary, Coinbase Inc. I joined Coinbase in 2018 after serving as Chief Financial Officer at Sculptor Capital and OneWest Bank, and have over 20 years of experience in the finance industry.</p><p>Today I’d like to introduce Coinbase, discuss the evolution of crypto, and highlight how today’s regulations could be changed to advance the bipartisan goals of protecting consumers and promoting innovation.</p><p>Coinbase’s mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. We were founded in 2012 with the idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin. Over the last nine years, our products and services have expanded to meet our customers’ needs in the rapidly innovating crypto industry. We have customers in every state except Hawaii and, as a remote-first company, we have employees in 45 states and the District of Columbia, including 24 of the 25 states represented by the members of this committee.</p><p>We now securely store 12% of the world’s crypto across more than 150 asset types, we offer customers the opportunity to learn about and buy, sell, send and receive more than 100 assets. We also offer customers the opportunity to spend, borrow, earn and stake on select assets. We serve more than 73 million customers globally, including 10,000 institutions and 185,000 application developers. Importantly, nearly 50% of our transacting customers are doing something other than buying and selling crypto, which indicates to us that crypto is moving beyond its initial investment phase into the long expected utility phase.</p><p>Since our founding, Coinbase has strived to be the most secure, trusted, and legally compliant bridge to the cryptoeconomy. Coinbase is federally registered as a money services business with FinCEN, licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states, holds a “BitLicense’’ and trust charter from the New York Department of Financial Services, and we are authorized to engage in consumer lending in 15 states.</p><p>We have a robust AML/BSA program, and we are one of only two digital asset members of the Department of the Treasury’s Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group.</p><p>In addition to the various state regulatory regimes, we are subject to federal oversight from Treasury, the CFTC, SEC, FTC, and CFPB.</p><p>Much like the adoption curve of the Internet in the 1990s, we are seeing dramatic advancements in crypto participation. There are more than 220 million crypto holders globally, and around 16 percent of Americans have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency. Total crypto market capitalization at the end of Q3 was over $2.0 trillion, up from $800 billion at the end of 2020.</p><p>Coinbase’s platform is powering the cryptoeconomy — a new financial system for the internet age — which is a critical infrastructure layer to Web 3.0. Technologies like non-fungible tokens, which we call NFTs, and decentralized application platforms will lead the way for Web 3.0 to revolutionize the internet, much like the internet was revolutionized when it went from static content to a place for dynamic engagement.</p><p>We believe sound regulation is central to fueling crypto innovation and adoption. That is why we introduced our Digital Asset Policy Proposal, which we refer to as dapp. The dApp assessed the challenges of the existing regulatory framework and proposed a four pillar solution.</p><p>First, we believe the government should regulate digital assets under a new, comprehensive framework that recognizes the unique technological innovations underpinning digital assets.</p><p>Second, responsibility for this new framework should be assigned to a single federal regulator. This regulator would be charged with establishing a registration process for intermediaries, which we refer to as Marketplaces for Digital Assets.</p><p>Third, this new framework should have three goals to ensure holders of digital assets are empowered and protected: A) Enhance transparency through robust and appropriate disclosure requirements. B) Protect against fraud and market manipulation. And C) Promote efficiency and strengthen market resiliency.</p><p>Our fourth and final pillar is to ensure that regulatory solutions promote interoperability and fair competition.</p><p>In conclusion, Coinbase believes crypto will drive transformational change across society in positive ways. That is why our mission is to promote economic freedom around the world. Disruption always challenges the status quo, but we believe sound policy solutions can improve the system for everyone. We applaud Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry and the members of this Committee for holding this hearing. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these important issues, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=441d4353c768" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/opening-testimony-u-s-house-committee-on-financial-services-441d4353c768">Opening Testimony: U.S. House Committee on Financial Services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CZ2rjALbzvjiYnW_Yk6Vnw.jpeg" /></figure><p>We’re excited to announce the open sourcing of <strong><em>Kryptology</em></strong>. Kryptology is a cryptographic library for the Crypto community that will enable and empower developers to create novel crypto innovations with state-of-the-art cryptography.</p><p><strong>At Coinbase, cryptography is a first-class citizen</strong>. We’re passionate about cryptography as a driver for innovation in crypto. It is the most important mechanism for delivering delightful user experiences, and it enables privacy solutions that will change the security paradigm.</p><p>Why do we believe this?</p><p><strong>Crypto is founded on cryptographic innovation.</strong> As described in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3132259"><em>Bitcoin’s academic pedigree</em></a>, Bitcoin used existing, but not-yet-production, academic cryptography (hashcash, Chaum’s E-cash, Merkle trees) with economic game-theory to solve the Byzantine Generals problem.</p><p><strong>Crypto changes cryptography.</strong> The feedback loop is running at warp speed. Cryptographers created private transactions with zero-knowledge techniques in <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-oakland2014.pdf">ZCash</a>, <em>The Internet Computer</em> is built on new cryptographic <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/339">breakthroughs</a>, Monero uses <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringCT.html">ring signatures</a> to gain confidentiality, skale is using <a href="https://skale.network/blog/introducing-bls-rollup/">BLS</a> to create roll-ups to improve scale and reduce storage on-chain, and Mina and ZCash use <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-releases-code-for-halo-2/">Halo 2</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/">Pasta</a>.</p><p><strong>Coinbase also strives to bring near-future cryptography into production. </strong><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/zksnarks-and-cryptographic-accumulators-f840da0b61c6">zkSNARKS and Cryptographic Accumulators</a>, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/frost-flexible-round-optimized-schnorr-threshold-signatures-b2e950164ee1">FROST</a>, and <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/production-threshold-signing-service-b16017c09661">Threshold Signing</a>.</p><p>While enabling further innovation is our primary goal, we also aim for Kryptology to elevate the standard for what is considered to be a robust, usable cryptographic library. The library provides developers with a toolbox of secure, audited, and easy-to-use APIs. Kryptology is designed to be misuse-resistant (i.e., “hard to screw up”), so developers can focus on what they do best. We hope this translates to more projects that build and grow the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>A guide to Kryptology, including full documentation, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/kryptology">repository</a>. This includes common development issues and lessons learned from our years of experience with cryptographic implementations. We hope these learnings will be uniquely valuable for others that want to support developers and build great user experiences. Over time, our goal is to support a thriving ecosystem of new and working cryptography for many more applications.
